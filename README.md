# Description
I am not a profession python coder. I am still learning and I made it on my Kali Linux 21.2. So I can surely say that it will work on kali and similar kind of OS. In future I'll try to add some other feature and make it compatble with Windows, MacOS and other flavor of linux.
# NOTE!!!
You should have working internet connection and root/sudo permission. **THIS IS NOT A PERMANENT FIX. YOU STILL NEED TO CHANGE THE CMOS BATTERY LATER**
# Setup
- `git clone https://github.com/MrRafsan/noCMOS.git`
- `cd noCMOS`
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- `python3 noCMOS.py`
# What is CMOS
CMOS stands for **Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor**. The CMOS battery powers the BIOS firmware in your computer. BIOS needs to remain operational even when your computer isn't plugged into a power source. And because of CMOS battery the time of your computer never reset until the juice runs out.
